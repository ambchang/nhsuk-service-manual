  <h2>Measuring success</h2>
  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>Benchmark as-is IA and content performance during Discovery in order to measure improvements in Beta and Live. Ensure you understand your users’ priority tasks for your content. Can you get more people to the information they need more easily?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved IA improves the findability of content (known-item access). Tree tests are one way of measuring findability.</li>
    <li>Improved IA improves the discoverability of content (unknown-item access). Site analytics can measure journeys through content.</li>
    <li>Optimised site search improves findability. Site search logs measure successful searches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Improved IA and search should mean:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More people navigate to your content</li>
    <li>More people find your content having entered a relevant on-site search term</li>
    <li>More people go on longer journeys around your content (not just single-page visits)</li>
    <li>More people start a relevant transactional journey</li>
    <li>More people visit high priority content (eg that helps them accomplish the most common tasks - Top Tasks)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>SEO</h3>
  <p>Changes to page structures affect SEO, but we should remember that NHS.UK has huge authority so it is difficult to harm our Google rankings.</p>
  <p>Technical SEO is concerned with making a website easy for search engines to crawl, removing barriers such as crawl errors. Content and CMS activities contribute to technical SEO on live content. The IA page templates help search engines understand the relationship between content and importance of pages by providing a clear structure.</p>
