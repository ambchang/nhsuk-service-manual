  <p>You should have a measurement framework in place. This will be different for every team, depending on your key performance indicators. You need to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>know what success looks like</li>
    <li>have base-lined any measures</li>
    <li>can evidence that your IA is successful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To meet your users' and organisational needs, you need to demonstrate the following for any new or transformed content.</p>

  <h2>You have based your IA on user needs</h2>
  <p>You've designed, tested and iterated your IA based on user research. This means users can browse to all of your content.</p>
  <p>If you're adding to an existing website, you can show that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you meet side-wide user needs as well as topic user needs</li>
    <li>you know about any larger content group your topic belongs to</li>
    <li>the labels you use sit meaningfully alongside existing content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>You can show that users pick up a good information scent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users looking for your topic find it when they start from elsewhere on the website.</li>
    <li>The way you've grouped content and the labels you've used lead users to what they're interested in.</li>
    <li>You include links and synonyms in visible indexes, like the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">Health A to Z on the NHS website</a>.</li>
    <li>You have considered users’ journeys around the wider topic and linked to associated conditions, treatments, lifestyle improvements or services.</p>
  </ul>

  <h2>You can demonstrate success through analytics</h2>
  <p>Benchmark your as-is IA and content performance during discovery. Then show improvements in beta and live.</p>
  <p>Make sure you understand your users' priority tasks and show that you get more people to the information they need more easily.</p>
  <p>Show that your IA helps more users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>find known content – you can measure this, for example, through tree tests</li>
    <li>discover unknown content – site analytics can measure journeys through content (not just single page visits)</li>
    <li>start relevant transactional journeys</li>
    <li>visit high priority content that helps them do their most common tasks – "top tasks"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Users find content through external and internal search engines</h2>
  <h3>Search engine optimisation (SEO) for external search engines</h3>
  <p>You have made sure that your topic is easy to find in external search engines through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>user-centred content, including headings</li>
    <li>user-centred metadata</li>
    <li>a clear structure (including URL structure) and labelling around your page or topic</li>
    <li>cross-linking to and from related topics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you've changed the IA around an existing topic, it may affect search results. Baseline your search ranking and traffic from search engines and measure again when you have improved your structure and labelling. (But remember, if your content is on the NHS website, it has such authority that it is difficult to harm its content's Google rankings.)</p>
  <p>For new topics, monitor search rankings for key words when they go live and then review them.</p>
  <p>You've covered technical SEO, for example, by making the website easy for search engines to crawl.</p>
   Content and CMS activities contribute to technical SEO on live content. The IA page templates help search engines understand the relationship between content and importance of pages by providing a clear structure.</p>
  <h3>Internal search</h3>
  <p>Large websites benefit from on-site search engine. , you have added synonyms for your topic and prioritised results.</p>
    <h4>You can show that users find your content through on-site search</h4>
  <p>Large websites If you have a larOptimise your site search so that it ser .... Your site search logs should show successful searches. by entering a relevant on-site search term</p>
synonyms, page titles and meta data</p>








  <h2>You have page templates for different levels of your IA</h2>
  <p>


  <ul>
    <li>A content inventory exists and documents all related content from across NHS.UK</li>

    <p>You have page templates for different levels of IA</p>
    hey need to create different page templates that reflect the different levels of their IA. And if they user the NHS website IA, presumably they will need strong evidence before they propose any alternative IA templates? stress the importance of levels of information, allowing users to navigate from larger to smaller topics of information. But definitely, a lot of evidence would be needed
    <h2>You agree any changes to the NHS website with the IA team</h2>

        <li>Any changes and additions have been agreed with the IA team so they can be made available to others and fit in with the navigation system as a whole</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>All topic content is available via hub pages</li>
        <li>All related content is available in context where needed</li>
        <li>Links, page titles and URLs are consistent throughout</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Topic links and synonyms for the Health A to Z and site search have been designed, tested and added</li>
    <li>The topic location within the wider NHS.UK IA and taxonomy has been considered and agreed by governance process</li>
      <ul>
      <h2>You follow good URL practice</h2>
        <p>The URL policy has been followed</p>
        <p>Create machine- and human-readable URLs.
Page sets with a clear URL structure (parent and child pages), with links to child pages from the parent page, can generate sitelinks (enhanced results) in search results.</p>



    <p>your URLs conform to the URL policy in the service manual (to be published around the end of 2021).</p>
