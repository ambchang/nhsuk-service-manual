<h2>Background to the IA process</h2>
<p>When improving the information architecture of topics within a large website that holds a plethora of related information (e.g. NHS.UK is a website about healthcare information), it is important to transform each element in a consistent way.</p>
<p>NHS.UK has a dedicated information architecture team who have applied their learnings to create a set of instructions to help other transform their IA.</p>
<p>Therefore, this guidance should be followed while being mindful that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is based on the IA of a large website with a large target audience</li>
  <li>it will be a reflection of the work being done on NHS.UK</li>
  <li>the guidance should be used by external users as a guideline of good practice, with the understanding that not all of our principles and processes will be applicable.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Stages of the core IA process</h2>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>There are four key stages to the core IA process. They are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>understanding</li>
  <li>ideation</li>
  <li>application</li>
  <li>live</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages will help teams to start a new IA transformation, and support them all the way through to monitoring the impact of the improvements once live.</p>

<h2>Guidance for transforming IA in specific scenarios</h2>
<p>The process for IA has been adapted to consider specific scenarios.</p>
<p>There is an underlying awareness that different topics and different teams may need different support when doing an IA transformation. Therefore, to supplement the core process stages, there is also additional guidance around the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>transforming a topic that is similar to one that has already been transformed</li>
  <li>moving a section of content</li>
  <li>adding a page</li>
  <li>removing a page</li>
  <li>adding a transactional service</li> 
  <li>updating a homepage</li>
  <li>transforming a huge topic</li>
  <li>transforming a small topic</li>
  <li>creating a new hub</li> 
  <li>when teams don't have representation from all professions</li>
  <li>adding an entirely new section of content</li>
  <li>removing an entire section of content</li>
  <li>adding a sub-topic to a main-topic hub</li>
  <li>when projects have a small timescale to deliver</li>
  <li>adding or removing to top level navigation or a footer</li>
</ul>
